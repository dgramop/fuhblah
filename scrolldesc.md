### (only one scene)
Dart hits dart board, animates right to left, when the dart hits, boom you got a logo and that slides down into the navbar and the homepage is revealed
OR
.. different segments of the dartboard link to different parts of the site and provide a sales pitch and overview



### Scene 1
Stack of papers and other things in the scene (desk, clock) frustrated individual (human or other character), trashy room, window (or fan)
Temporary navbar to quickly login? maybe sprites will be the links to login and stuff?

Window animates open or fan animates to spinning. 

If we go with a window animation, there should be two images, one that stays fixed and one that goes up with the scroll (the shutter).

Breeze animates from right to left. This can be an SVG that is drawn as user scrolls. A single paper flies off the stack
The rest of the room stays fixed and the camera follows the paper float down. (or just legit straight lines)

Paper does some acrobatic crap and then eventually becomes fullscreen? Paper is a flyer for accuracy. 

Links, login etc. are at the paper

### Potential scene 2
The paper lands in another stack in a less trashy room with a happier person who no longer has to worry about finances. Paper substituted for a bill?
